Jenkins Notes

During:

Jenkins Autostart if server restarts
    shouldn't be too hard

Jenkins Temp Internet Access
    3 ways to do this:
        direct via 1 subnet and IG
        indirect via 2 subnets and nat
        indirect via proxy
    personally leaning towards 2 subnet solution
    nonprod made subnet too big, would have to start from scratch, is ok though. 

Where to send jenkins logs?
    put in user


BEFORE Implementation:

server splot:
    2 Jenkins servers
    1 prod, 1 nonprod
    use same jenkins for prod fic/prof and prod user/smd

locations:
    admin VPC, keep it relatively separate from the system
    need to create admin vpc for nonprod


connectivity:
    aws console
        can use VPC endpoints
    github 
        might not be possible, due to VPC issues
        TRICKY (need guidance)
        workarounds:
            use s3? - slow and inefficient
            host git server on jenkins itself:
                make script to mirror git repo to run from gfe
    appstream
        need internet connection OR can go via VPC
    proxies?
        i dont think it should have access

automation as code:
    instead of manually configuring jobs, turn them into a pipeline


jobs:
    redeploy proxies
    switch out appstream image
        supply parameters
    move lambdas and alerts to jenkins
        cons
            dont fix what isnt broken
        pros
            have all automation in single location
        decision:
            go forward, but low priority

    build image? (TRICKY/Long term)
        need to find how the imagebuilder GUI works
    test proxy connectivity
        needs connectivity to appstream, can do via VPC pairing
